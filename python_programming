Write a Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or Zero?
Ans:-
Here is a Python program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero
def check_number(number):
    if number > 0:
        print("This number is positive")
    elif number < 0:
        print("This number is negative")
    else:
        print("This is zero")
        
num=int(input("enter your number"))
result=check_number(num)

We have written above code for named check_number to check the given number if the number is negative , positive of zero
firsst we compare the given number to zero with if elase condition and and then we call the same function with variable to get number from input user .

Write a Python Program to Check if a Number is Odd or Even?
Ans:-
Here's a Python program that checks if a number is odd or even
def check_odd_number(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("this is a even number")
    else:
        print("this is odd number")
    

num=int(input("your number is :"))

result=check_odd_number(num)

here we have written code for as wrote a function for checking the number for odd or even using if else condition, then we called the same function with the calling variables.


Write a Python Program to Check Leap Year?
Ans:-
Here we have written below function for checking weather year is leap or not :-
def check_leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 ==0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 ==0):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not leap year")
        
yrs=int(input("enter your year"))

result=check_leap_year(yrs)


Write a Python Program to Check Prime Number?
Ans:-
here we have written code to check weather number is prime or not.
def cehck_prime_number(number):
    if number <= 1:
        print(f"{number} this is not prime number")
    for i in range(2,int(number**0.5)+1):
        if number % i ==0:
            print(f"{number} this is not prime number")
            return
    print(f"{number} is prime number")
        
num=int(input("your given number"))

result=cehck_prime_number(num)


Write a Python Program to Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval of 1-10000?
Ans:-
here we have written function for print the prime numbers between 1 to 10000
def write_prime_numbers(start,end):
    prime_numbers=[]
    for number in range(start,end+1):
        if number > 1:
            for i in range(2,int(number**0.5)+1):
                if number % i == 0:
                    break
                else:
                    prime_numbers.append(number)
    print("prime numbers in interval of 1-10000")
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        print(prime)
        
start=1
end=10000

write_prime_numbers(start,end)
